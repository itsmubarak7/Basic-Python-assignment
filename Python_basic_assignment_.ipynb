        "#4. Can keywords be used as variable name ?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, keyword can't be used as veriable name because keyword is defined as a special meaning.\n",

        "#6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable because we can add or modify elements but tuples are immutable because it restricts to add or modify element.\n",

        "\n",
        "Type casting refers to type conversion from one data type to other.\n",

        "  \n",
        "Implicit type casting done by complier itself whereas explicit conversion refers to casting where it is done by programmer .\n",

        "Conditional statements are used in python code to check and return a value if condition is true or false .\n",
